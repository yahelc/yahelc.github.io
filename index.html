<p>Yahel is the Director of Insight Products at <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/">Blue State Digital</a>.Yahel works on product development and data products, specializing in technical development, data analysis, and website experimentation. He leverages expertise in web analytics, databases, data design, web development, digital marketing, and product development to inform client strategies, tactics, and outcomes across Blue State Digital's diverse client mix. His past work includes website optimization and development of custom data tools for clients as diverse as Ford, Partners in Health, Google, and Obama for America, for whom he developed their main web analytics tracking code.

<p></p>In 2012, Yahel took a leave of absence from Blue State Digital to join the Obama Presidential campaign full-time in Chicago, serving as a Senior Digital Analyst on the Digital Analytics team. He helped manage optimization and testing efforts, primarily around website fundraising and email, assisting in the raising of tens of millions of additional dollars, and contributing to the record grassroots digital fundraising effort that saw nearly $700 million raised online. For his work on the Obama campaign, he was cited by Cook Political Report as a "data rock star."</p>

<p>Prior to joining BSD, Yahel served as a Web Manager at the University of Pennsylvania, where he managed an online learning site. He previously helped manage online campaigns for J Street as an Technology and Online Assistant through the 2008 campaign.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Yahel built and manages <a href="http://www.sharedcount.com/">SharedCount.com</a>, a free social media analytics service that serves 3 billion API calls per year, which was hailed by SEOMoz as the top "ugly SEO tool that rocks". Yahel is also a member of the Google Analytics Professional program.</p>
