<p>Yahel Carmon was Director of Analytics Tech, and Deputy Director of Digital Analytics for Hillary for America.</p>

<p>Previously, he was Director of Insight Products at Blue State Digital. There, his work includes product management, website optimization and development of custom data tools for clients as diverse as Ford, Partners in Health, Google, and Obama for America, for whom he developed their main web analytics tracking code.</p>

<p>In 2012, Yahel took a leave of absence from Blue State Digital to join the Obama Presidential campaign full-time in Chicago, serving as a Senior Digital Analyst on the Digital Analytics team. He helped manage optimization and testing efforts, primarily around website fundraising and email, assisting in the raising of tens of millions of additional dollars, and contributing to the record grassroots digital fundraising effort that saw nearly $700 million raised online. For his work on the Obama campaign, he was cited by Cook Political Report as a "data rock star."</p>

<p>In his spare time, Yahel built and manages <a href="http://www.sharedcount.com/">SharedCount.com</a>, a free social media analytics service that serves more than six billion API calls per year, and which was hailed by SEOMoz as the top "ugly SEO tool that rocks".</p>
