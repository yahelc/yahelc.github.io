<h2>Bio</h2>

<p>Yahel is Deputy Director of Analytics at <a href="http://www.bluestatedigital.com/">Blue State Digital</a>. As a member of the Analytics team, Yahel works on both internal analytics development and client-specific tracking projects, specializing in technical implementation and experimental analytics.</p>

<p>In 2012, Yahel took a leave of absence from Blue State Digital to join the Obama Presidential campaign full-time in Chicago, serving as a Senior Analyst on the Digital Analytics team. He helped manage optimization and testing efforts, primarily around fundraising and email, assisting in the raising of tens of millions of additional dollars, and contributing to the record grassroots digital fundraising effort that saw nearly $700 million raised online.</p>

<p>Prior to joining BSD, Yahel served as a Web Manager at the University of Pennsylvania, where he managed an online learning site. He previously helped manage online campaigns for J Street as an Technology and Online Assistant through the 2008 campaign.</p>

<p>In his spare time, Yahel built and manages <a href="http://www.sharedcount.com/">SharedCount.com</a>, a free social media analytics service that serves 3 billion API calls per year, which was hailed by SEOMoz as the top "ugly SEO tool that rocks". Yahel is also a member of the Google Analytics Professional program.</p>
